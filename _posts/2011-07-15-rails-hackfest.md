The Ruby on Rails community is holding a [Hackfest](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/7/14/rails-3-1-hackfest) next weekend to stabilize Rails 3.1. This is a great idea! You should help out too!

[Bloomfire](http://bloomfire.com/) is opening our space on Saturday for hackfesters. We'll open at 9:00 AM on Saturday and stay as late as needed. Please oh please plan on stopping by and helping make Rails 3.1 awesome. Bring your Rails apps to upgrade or help out your fellow Rubyist. We'll even make sure you are fed.

Bloomfire is located on Main Street in Lehi. Hope to see you there!
