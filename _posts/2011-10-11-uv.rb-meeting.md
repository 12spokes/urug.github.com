We had a really great meeting tonight. [Chris Smith](http://github.com/quartzmo) gave a brilliant session on using lightweight JavaScript MVC frameworks within a Rails app. He went into depth on the subtle differences between [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and [spine.js](http://spinejs.com/). And by popular vote [Mike Moore](http://github.com/blowmage) is to use backbone.js on his next project, even though spine.js is more obscure than [sammy.js](http://sammyjs.org/), his long term preference.

Next [David Brady](http://github.com/dbrady) amazed us by demonstrating actually testing a Rails app's JavaScript frontend using [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and [jasmine-node](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node). And the crazy thing is that is actually worked!
